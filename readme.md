## What is it?

This is an old, addictive and very hard Macromedia Flash game I made in 2013 and now thanks to the [Ruffle emulator](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) it can now be played again and it even plays well on a modern smartphone and a pad although it was originally designed for a desktop pc, mouse and browser!

## Play it now…

Hosted right here on GitHub: [https://mhatxotic.github.io/StarCatch](https://mhatxotic.github.io/StarCatch).

## How to play…

* Simply click on all the objects you see. It helps both hand-eye co-ordination.
* Missing an object will decrease your time by 5 seconds and multiplier by a half so don't miss. Time is never docked when the time remaining is under 10 seconds.
* Grabbing stars will increase your score and multiplier.
* Egg-timer objects will greatly increase time.
* Ying-yang objects will greatly increase multiplier.
* Circular objects with arrows suck all the objects into the void and give a fraction of any applicable bonuses.
* Destroy invaders before they leave the screen or they will steal your time, multiplier and score.
* The smaller the object, the higher the gains.
* Destroy invaders in quick succession will grant a multiplier bonus every single hit.
* For each 5 invaders destroyed in quick succession will grant a familiar 'killing spree' rank increasing your time multiplier every single hit.
* Grab 5 or more grouped stars to get a super multiplier bonus.
* Grab 8 or more grouped stars to get a mega multiplier and time bonus.
* Shiny stars act as 5 stars only when clicked directly.
* Get a multiplier and time bonus for every 100 stars accumulated.
* Increasing stages gradually get harder with more and more invaders.
* Gaining time when it is under 10 seconds gives you an extra bonus to time.
* Completing a stage when the remaining time is under 30 seconds resets your time to 30 seconds, else you use the time you finished the stage with.

## Issues and other info…

Since Flash is obsolete and one no longer has access to the Flash authoring software, the game can no longer be updated, unless someone knows a way to hack a legal CS6 Web Premimum for Mac to work on a ARM processor via Rosetta.

* The game is 99.9% functional with the Ruffle emulator.
* There is a bug that the background stars may appear off the stage.
* (Ruffle) The title and stage complete music will not loop.
* (Ruffle) The score does not update properly until it changes when starting a new stage.
* (Ruffle) The quality and full-screen keys may not work.
* (Ruffle) There is no thousand separators localisation.
